II. WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION

Many amendments and improvements, miscellaneous bug fixes, added flirts for Sime, revised areas.

III. INSTALLATION

1. Backup your OVERRIDE folder and DIALOG.TLK file located in the main BG2 directory.
2. UnRAR the downloaded archive into the main BG2 folder.
3. If there is no WeiDU.LOG file in your main BG2 directory please create the new blank WeiDU.LOG file there.
4. Launch the Setup-TS.EXE file.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions.

IV. UNINSTALLATION

1. Launch the Setup-TS.EXE file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.
3. If you want to return to the absolutely clean pre-installed state, please delete your OVERRIDE folder and DIALOG.TLK file and then move (copy/paste) their backup copies into the main BG2 directory. Then remove the SETUP-TS.DEBUG and Install_TSAreaSounds.BAT files. Eventually, open your WeiDU.log file with any text editor and remove the lines created by TS installer.

V. HOW TO PLAY

You must start a new game from the very beginning, otherwise the new characters won’t appear. Kachiko is located in the dungeon of Irenicus, that is why don’t skip it! If you play evil character and work for Bodhi, you won’t meet Sime in the game, but Coran is still available. However, it’s worthwhile to try playing both paths, because the plot is different in both cases. Valygar is flirtable, much like NPCs in PST, so to flirt with him, you just need to initiate dialogue at any time. For more questions, please visit our forum boards and read FAQs at:

VI. COMPATIBILITY

Unlike the previous version of TS the new version is supposed to be compatible with most of the mods around. However there may be logical incompatibility issues which I cannot foresee right now. Please take in mind that this mod introduces the earlier version of Valygar’s romance and logically incompatible with Corthala Romance written later by Domi.

VII. LAST MINUTE TIPS

2. Be kind to Kachiko in the first meeting dialogue, otherwise she will attack your party.
3. Sime is located in the secret chamber of Aran Linvail. But you may find her there only if you work for Aran. I guess it's obvious.
4. Working for Bodhi will give you opportunity to join her for a short period of time... But in really dire time... No more tips on this issue.
5. It is worthwhile to investigate the whole island before entering Yoshimoto's compound.
6. Attacking Hashimoto or stealing something in their castle can be dangerous. It is really a bad choice. They are very powerful and will make a stand against any intruders.
7. And please, don't kill Najoki Nakanishi. Though being Nakanishi, she is a good person and might give you valuable information if you're kind to her.
8. The same is true about Hitomi Nakanishi. Leave him for his suicide ritual instead of fighting him.
9. Try to talk to any important character (like Hitomi or Aino) with your wisest NPC. You will get additional and essential dialogue options.
10. Upon entering Spellhold for the meeting with Irenicus, prepare to surprises.
11. Don't try to take elemental katanas away from the duel arena!
12. Valygar Romantique is available only for a female PC, though he has some additional banters with other NPCs unrelated to the romance. He has to be picked up before moving to Temple Ruins in order to initiate the romance.
13. There is a progressive conflict between Valygar and Anomen. Eventually, they may start fighting. Take that into consideration.
14. Valigar's armor and katana are significantly improved making him a worthy ally.
15. Sime is romancable for female PCs too, though her lesbian romance is shorter and less active.
16. There is a new familiar, Veter (of Sime), which is available from quick/inventory slots.
