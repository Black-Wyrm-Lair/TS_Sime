Uncle Lero said however that Cousin Willy's play would be just the same no matter what title he uses. So Cousin Willy called it "A Play Without a Name". Which apparently was a captivating title. Or so the critics said.~
== VPSIMEB ~Good for your Cousin Willy!~
== BJAN ~Not exactly, the problem was that the general opinion was that the play failed to deliver what the captivating title promised. People were so mad that Cousin Willy switched the name to "A Lovestory of Teomund and Allastria Which Happened During the Times of Troubles in the Great and Prosperous City of Baldur's Gate Governed by the Most Respectable Dukes".~

== VPSIMEB ~So?~
== BVALYGA ~You will have the tale, or I will not have rest?~
== VPSIMEB ~Yes, your guess is right.~
== BVALYGA ~Very well. I was a boy of eight years and I played around Corthala’s mansion. By chance I went through a secret entrance...~
== VPSIMEB ~(*smiles*) By chance?~
== BVALYGA ~Accidentally. It lead to a room my mother used for summoning. I saw her, standing against flames, crying out the words of the spell in agony... Then the demon appeared in the flames. It growled and pointed at me, mocking my fear, asking mother if I was to be killed. Mother managed to control the demon, but her anger was so terrible, that I thought I’d prefer to be eaten by the demon...~
== VPSIMEB ~She was just scared for your life, I am sure.~
== BVALYGA ~I know now. I did not know then. You heard the tale, now you think you will go sleep and leave me alone?~

== BVICONI ~I know of none. Drizzt * spits * brought misfortune and ill fate to all of the Menzoberranzan. I doubt that anyone would feel anything but loathing for him and his choices. Drizzt's treachery strengthened my people's resolve to keep to their own ways.~
