== VPKACHIB ~The mind has no boundaries, Sime. A philosopher may never leave his straw mat but his mind will travel the highest mountains and the deepest gorges and see the things clearer than the one who has climbed to the top.~
== VPSIMEB ~I do not think I would derive satisfaction from a road walked only in my mind.~

== VPKACHIB ~And you do not believe so?~
== VPSIMEB ~No, I do not. He is wedging the knife deeper in his wound and twisting it, causing himself more pain and more sorrow. I told him that many times, but he would not listen. He will understand one day, but it will be too late.~
