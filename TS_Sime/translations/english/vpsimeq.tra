@0    = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I must be brief. My terrible Master will come searching for me if I do not return promptly. I am one of the noble ladies imprisoned by the most awful dragon. We beg you to save us, my good <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@1    = ~That's why I am here, my good Lady. Care to give me more instructions?~
@2    = ~The Dragon, whose true name is too terrible to pronounce, is in the cave north of here and so are all of his captives. I had a vision that the most honorable warrior is coming to deliver us from our misfortune and I have taken few items from the treasure hoard that might help you in your quest, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Please, hurry!~
